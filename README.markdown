**Briskhome** is a work-in-progress **extensible open-source house monitoring and automation system** for Node.js that is limited by your imagination only.

<!-- See live demo of **Briskhome** web interface at **[demo.briskhome.com]()**. -->

## Installation
The best way to get your hands on **Briskhome** as quickly as possible is with **Vagrant**. Simply clone this repository and run `vagrant up`. This will download a minimal linux image, set it up for the best **Briskhome** experience and seed it with demo data.

For a real-world installation we recommend using prebuilt installation packages. We provide packages for current versions of Ubuntu, Debian and CentOS. Grab the most recent version from [releases](/briskhome/briskhome/releases) page and install it with your package manager of choice.
