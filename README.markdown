---
**Briskhome** is a work-in-progress **extensible open-source house monitoring and automation system** for Node.js that is limited by your imagination only.

<!-- See live demo of **Briskhome** web interface at **[demo.briskhome.com]()**. -->

## Installation
> **Heads Up!** Very thorough installation instructions are available in the [documentation](http://docs.briskhome.com/).

The best way to get your hands on **Briskhome** as quickly as possible is with **Vagrant**. Simply clone this repository and run `vagrant up`. This will download and configure a minimal linux image, install all the dependencies and seed your **Briskhome** installation with demo data.

For a real-world installation we recommend using prebuilt installation packages. We provide packages for current versions of Ubuntu, Debian and CentOS. Download them from [releases](/briskhome/briskhome/releases) page and install it with your package manager of choice.

## Documentation
Up-to-date documentation is available **[online at docs.briskhome.com](http://docs.briskhome.com/)** and is divided into three major sections:
* **[Administrator Guide](http://docs.briskhome.com/en/latest/admin/index.html)** covers the initial server setup and configuration, installing software dependencies and deploying.
* **[Developer Handbook](http://docs.briskhome.com/en/latest/developer/index.html)** explains system APIs and teaches how to create additional **Briskhome** plugins.
* **[User Manual](http://docs.briskhome.com/en/latest/manual/index.html)** contains detailed usage instructions for end users.
